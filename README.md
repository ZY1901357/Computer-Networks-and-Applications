### Weighting:  20% (200 Marks)

### Task description:
In this assignment, you will be writing code to simulate the Distance Vector routing protocol in a network of routers.

CBOK categories: Impacts of ICT, Professional Communication, Working Individually, ICT Fundamentals, ICT
Infrastructure, Computational Science and Engineering 

### Aims
Learn about routing protocols and route propagation.
Implement a routing protocol.

### Overview
In this assignment, you will be writing code to simulate a network of routers performing route advertisement using a Distance Vector routing protocol.

You will need to implement the algorithm in its basic form, and then with Split Horizon to improve the performance of the protocol. Your implementation will need to ensure that the simulated routers in the network correctly and consistently converge their distance and routing tables to the correct state.

You will find a more detailed description of the Distance Vector algorithm in the course notes and in section 5.2.2 of Kurose and Ross, Computer Networking, 7th Edition.
